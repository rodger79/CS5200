Outline
Problem Statement: 
How does one decrease sustainment costs for a system that is too expensive to replace? Once specific air force mission system consists of over 90% deprecated and vendor unsupported systems and  would cost 2.4 billion dollars to upgrade. It is common for these types of systems to be operated much differently than modern corporate IT enterprises. The sustainment cost provide to this program are approximately 2.5 million dollars per year. What possible solutions can be provided by modern architecture technology to solve the problem. Potential solutions include building a private cloud or virtualizing portions of their enterprise. 
This brings up architectural challenges. How many of the systems consist of architectures that are not compatible with modern virtualization platforms that support primarily x86 and later architectures [reference needed]. Can some kind of instruction set translation be used to emulate these old architecture? How would virtualization affect endpoint devices that interface directly with hardware such as antenna controllers, receivers. How does this affect non internet protocol networks such as ATM ring networks or serial data connections. 
Modern virtualization networks are designed in this way.
Can you combine portions of a modernized system with deprecated? How would that work.
What architectures can be supported by which technology? Vmware supports some very deprecated systems such as RHEL 2.1, 3, 4; windows 3.1, NT, Server 2003; [8]
IBM: Solaris 8, 9, Spark, HP-UX
Proxmox
Hyperv: RHEL 5.x and up, windows server 2008 and up[9]
HP’s VSE
How does hardware (processor architecture) support virtualization technology.
-processor permission levels
-TLB[10] - lots of IEEE references

Background - where details come from
	Architecture
		How sol 8 works
		How modern systems works
		How to combine

Build - how you put it together

	-how it works
Conclusion - Build it
	-good stuff
	-bad stuff

Virtualizing Deprecated Systems
	Emulation vs Virtualization, also application streaming.(direct hosting of application in a stream, no virtualized OS).
	Virtual Machines Compatible with all x86 computers [3]. Legacy applications can be relied on by it’s users [4]. Virtualization of mission critical back end system increases chance of outage (unix, nonx86).
	IBM support for Solaris/ HPUX?
